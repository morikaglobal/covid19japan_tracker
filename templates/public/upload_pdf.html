<h6>About this app</h6>

<p><span>I built a web application that scrapes latest covid19 data for Japan for its 47 prefectures</span><span>from the Japanese government website and visualize the data in tableau dashboard.</span></p>
<br><br>

<p><span>The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare pubishes the latest information</span><span>on Coronavirus situation in Japan on almost daily basis on its <a href=>website</a> however I noticed that 1) many data are not presented visually, 2) most data is only available in Japanese and 3) data is pubilshed on the web in PDF format.</span></p>

  The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare pubishes the latest information on Coronavirus situation in Japan on almost daily basis on its <a href=>website</a> however I noticed that 1) many data are not presented visually, 2) most data is only available in Japanese and 3) data is pubilshed on the web in PDF format.</span></p>
<br><br>




  
  Previously I built a simple <a href="https://pythonnewsscraper.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">News
            Scraper APP</a> on the web using <strong>Python</strong> to scrape</span><span>the latest news
        from a specific news site using <strong>Beautiful Soup</strong> and <strong>Flask</strong>.</span>
    <br><br>
    <span>This time, I built slightly more advanced version of the app to scrape news data from a news
        article</span><span> using <strong>Python</strong> package <strong>newspaper3k</strong>, then deployed the app using <strong>Flask</strong> and on
        <strong>heroku</strong>.</span>

    <br><br>

    <span>First of all, when the URL link form above captures the URL link of a news article,</span><span> the
        <strong>newspaper3k</strong> package will extract and parse the data of the article with its Natural Language Processing.</span><span>For form input
        handling and validation, I used <strong>WTForms</strong> and
        <strong>requests</strong> libraries to grab the URL link entered in the form.</span><span>
        Then, from the data extracted I extract following data to render on the first part of my result
        page:</span>
    <br><br>


    <strong>Title</strong><br>
    <strong>Published date</strong><br>
    <strong>Author</strong><br>
    <strong>Top image (source link)</strong>
    <br><br>

    <span>At the same time, using the full text of the article extracted,</span><span>my app also generates
        <strong>WordCloud</strong> for the news article.</span><span>The WordCloud on the result page will display the
        words that are the most frequent among the news text extracted.</span><span><strong>io</strong> library is used
        to keep the WordCloud image in memory and <strong>base64</strong> to convert the resulting bytes</span><span> to
        base64 in order to return the image as part of our HTML response and render the image.</span>
        <span>* Please note WordCloud is currently disabled due to image storage issue</span>
    <br><br>

    <span>Lastly <strong>newspaper3k</strong> can also run its simple natural language processing to extract keywords from the news and also produce the summary of the article text.</span><br><br>

    <strong>Keywords (WordCloud image)</strong><br>
    <strong>Summary</strong>
    <br><br>
    <span>Keywords(WorldCloud) image and the summary of the news text will be displayed as the second part
        of the result page.</span>
